      <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica.
        Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you’d like to take in
        these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene,
        consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light
        pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter
        nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March
        and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles interact
        with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in
        September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the
        dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.</p>
